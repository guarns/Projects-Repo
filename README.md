# Projects Repository 
 - The purpose of this repository is to store all projects I create along my programming journey

## Project Categories (Levels): 
 1. Basic 
- Low in complexity: <5 functionalities
- <200 lines of code
- No libraries or frameworks
- General Guidelines:
    - Objectives: syntax, concepts, control flow (problem solving!)
    - Goal: 4-8 projects at this level
    - Examples: Digital Clock, To-Do, Expense Tracker, Static Website (Personal, Business), Vowel Counter, Pig Latin Generator, Weight Tracker, Recipes, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Note Taking
    - Note: the goal of projects within this category is not polishing or fine tuning, but applying fundamentals ("Good Enough")

 2. Intermediate 
- Mid range complexity: >5 functionalities
- <500 lines of code 
- Minimal use of libraries or frameworks (1-2)
- General Guidelines:
    - Objectives: Same as basic with slightly more effort required 
    - Goal: 3-6 (3 is good enough, additional may be made to ingrain concepts)
    - Examples: Games (Space Invaders, Snake, Tetris, Pong, Calculator, Web Scraper, Flash Card, Address Book (Contacts)
    - Note: the goal of projects within this category is to have more utility or components than a basic project, being more demanding, but still not as fleshed out as a capstone

 3. Capstone 
- Low in complexity: >10 functionalities
- 500 lines of code or more
- Use of multiple libraries and frameworks
- Use of integrations (databases, APIs, external software)
- General Guidelines:
    - Objectives: Should be interesting (attention grabbing) and a showcase of what you can do 
    - Goal: 1-3 (sweet spot of 2)
    - Examples: Social Media Clones (FB, LinkedIn, Instagram), Online Forum (Slack, Discord), E-Commerce Store (Ebay, Amazon), Crypto Tracker, Reservation System (Hotel, Airline), WYSIWG Editor
    - Note: the goal of projects within this category is to test your skills and provide examples of your work for interview purposes, albeit more time consuming to create
